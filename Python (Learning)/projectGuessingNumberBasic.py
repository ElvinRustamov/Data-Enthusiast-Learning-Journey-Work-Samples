# Instruction
# Create a program will generate a random number unknown to the user between upper and lower bond that user provided. The user needs to guess what that number is. If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.

# Your program should ask for upper and lower bound from the user initially.

# Calculate chances of user based on upper and lower bounds.

# Based on calculated number of chances ask input from user for guessing the number.

# If the guessed number is greater than the generated number then print - "You guessed too high", otherwise print - "You guessed too low". And finally if the numbers match print - "Congratulations you did it in"
