## About Me

I'm passionate about leveraging data to extract meaningful insights, build intelligent systems, and solve real-world problems. As a lifelong learner, this repository serves as a documentation of my journey into the vast and dynamic field of data.

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Mastering data analysis techniques
- [ ] Building robust data engineering pipelines
- [ ] Developing predictive models with machine learning
- [ ] Exploring the realms of artificial intelligence

## Projects

Here's a sneak peek into some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **Ebay Scraper:** I employ web scraping methods to gather data on PC laptops and netbooks available on eBay for analytical or research purposes.

Each project directory contains its own README with detailed information about the problem statement, methodologies, and results.

## Technologies

I'm actively exploring and working with the following technologies:

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and other data manipulation libraries
- SQL and NoSQL databases
- Machine learning frameworks (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau)
- Version control with Git

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and code in this repository. If you find anything interesting or have feedback, I'd love to hear from you!

To run a specific project, follow the instructions in the project's README file.

## How to Contribute
