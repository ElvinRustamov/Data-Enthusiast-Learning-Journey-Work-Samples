## Getting Started

Before starting with C++ programming, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use popular compilers such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang. These compilers are usually available through package managers on various operating systems.

## Basic Concepts

- Variables and Data Types
- Operators
- Input and Output
- Control Structures (if, else if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

## Control Flow

- Conditional Statements
- Looping Constructs
- Break and Continue Statements

## Data Types and Structures

- Fundamental Data Types (int, float, double, char, etc.)
- Arrays
- Strings
- Pointers

## Functions

- Function Declarations and Definitions
- Function Parameters
- Function Overloading
- Recursion

## Classes and Objects

- Declaring Classes
- Member Functions and Data Members
- Constructors and Destructors
- Member Access Control (Public, Private, Protected)
- Static Members
- Friend Functions and Classes

## Pointers and Memory Management

- Pointers and References
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (new, delete)
- Smart Pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr)

## File Handling

- File Streams (ifstream, ofstream, fstream)
- Reading and Writing Files
- Error Handling in File Operations

## Exception Handling

- try, catch, throw blocks
- Standard Exceptions
- Custom Exception Classes

## Templates

- Function Templates
- Class Templates

## Standard Template Library (STL)

- Containers (Vector, List, Deque, Set, Map, etc.)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
- Iterators

## Concurrency

- Threads
- Mutexes and Locks
- Thread Safety

## Advanced Topics

- Lambda Expressions
- Move Semantics
- Rvalue References
- C++11/14/17/20 Features

## Projects

- Shopping List Calculator with Qt (Basic)
- Paint with Program with Qt (Medium)
- File Mover Program with Qt (Medium)
- Bookstore Program with Qt (Advanced)
- Employee Information Program with Qt (Medium)
- TCP Server & Client with Qt (Advanced)
