## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental for any programmer or computer scientist. This repository serves as a collection of well-documented implementations of common data structures and algorithms, along with explanations and analysis.

## Languages

Currently, the implementations are provided in the following programming languages:

- Python
- Java
- C++

Contributions in other languages are welcome!

## Data Structures

The repository includes implementations of various data structures, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Trie
- and more...

Each data structure implementation includes detailed explanations of its properties, operations, and time complexities.

## Algorithms

The repository also contains implementations of essential algorithms, such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- Greedy Algorithms
- and more...

Each algorithm implementation includes explanations, time complexity analysis, and examples demonstrating its usage.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are highly encouraged! If you have improvements or new implementations of data structures and algorithms, feel free to submit a pull request. Please make sure your code is well-documented and follows the existing style and conventions.

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue.

Happy Coding!
