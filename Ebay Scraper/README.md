# Ebay Scraper Description

Welcome to the eBay Scraper project! In this Python-based initiative, I've crafted a versatile script encapsulated within the EbayScraper class. The script adeptly gathers product URLs and essential values associated with PC laptops and netbooks from eBay's expansive listings. The primary objective of this project is to construct a comprehensive dataset, facilitating subsequent analysis using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Explore and leverage the extracted data for insightful investigations into the world of PC laptops and netbooks. Happy coding and analyzing!
